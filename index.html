      <h1>For My Beloved</h1>
      <p>Since, you couldn't keep a love letter with yourself all your life this is a place that will stay until the end of Electricity and I am going to try and emboss everything I wanna say on this very place.</p>
      <p>I love you more than words can express.</p>
      <p>You are the most beautiful person in my life.</p>
      <p>
        I know I did not give you enough time and I haven't exactly been the
        ideal boyfriend either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is the truth, right from the start I knew this relationship no matter how great and perfect it has to eventually come to an end.
      </p>
      <p>I just knew I did not want to wreck your mental peace or your opinion about LOVE.</p>
      <p>
        I definitely tried very very very hard to not take advantage of you and
        your vulnerabilities. <span>(Gotta tell you wasn't easy at all cause you know MEN WILL BE MEN.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>However, that being said, in my own weird way, I tried to protect you from myself.</p>
      <p>I knew there was a very good chance that I could make love to you and never marry you.</p>
      <p>I tried to do the right thing all along the way.</p>
      <p>This meant pushing you away.</p>
      <p>I know I have pushed you away so so many many times.</p>
      <p>And I truly am <b>SORRY</b> for that I didn't mean to disappoint or hurt you the way I have.</p>
      <p>That's why I did not want to see you or talk to you as I knew that would create such ugly attachments for you.</p>
      <p>Hence, I never gave you all the time, gestures, efforts, affection, warmth, gestures that you truly deserved.</p>
      <p>You know I am a solo soarer and I never let my guards down. Infact I fake that I let people in and had my guards down by spending more time with them cracking more stupid jokes around them.</p>
      <p>However, with you its a different case.</p>
      <p>Very few people know me the way you do.</p>
      <p>They may alot about me but not about who I am.</p>
      <p><b>Only my family and you know me in a way from which my vulnerabilities are visible.</b></p>
      <p>That is how much you mean to me.</p>
      <p>I also felt that you were perfect for me however, as I have grown up sacrificing so many of my wantsü•≤ that now I don't feel the deep hurt and pain that you would be feeling.</p>
      <p>So, I know you are miserable than me. Sorry for that as well.</p>
      <p><b>WE DON'T ALWAYS GET WHAT WE WANT.</b> However, things turned out extremely great for me. I want you to have faith in your life and luck. I want you to be a WOMAN that makes me feel proud that I loved you.</p>
      <p>I am gonna try and make sure that I BECOME THE MAN THAT GIVES YOU BUTTERFLIES EVERYTIME YOU THINK OF ME.</p>
      <p>
        I guess all the apologies that I wanna make is over here.
      </p>
      <p>Let me tell you good parts.</p>
      <p>
        Usually for me good time is SEX.
      </p>
      <p>With you it was only holding your hands, looking at your face.</p>
      <p>Also you might be only WOMAN that I paid forüòÇ.</p>
      <p>I have so bad trust issues with women that I don't let myself take risks around them.</p>
      <p>So, guess, what I am trying to say is that I fell for you as if I were knocked in OBLIVION.</p>
      <p>And you ALWAYS fear what you can't control.</p>
      <p>In contrast, for me I didn't fear being around you.</p>
      <p>I was loving it.</p>
      <p>My mother's happiness comes before your happiness, I am not a silly boy who would forget how my mom raised me by sleeping half hungry.</p>
      <p>I am not the guy who will forget that her mother bought him new clothes, when she didn't fresh pair of undies for herself.</p>
      <p>So, I am breaking up with you.</p>
      <p>It is my call not to fight for you and sacrifice our relationship.</p>
      <p>I am a little disturbed/quirky whether or not this is the right thing to do or not. This may or may not be a mistake but if it is I will write here on this website again. </p>
      <p>Maybe sometime in the future.</p>
      <p>Look I love you. Letting you go is probably the biggest sacrifice I am making upto this point.</p>
      <p>LAST MINUTE ADVICE.</p>
      <p>1. Following your heart isn't always the best thing in the world practically speaking. However, when it comes to relationships be it friends, sexual, parents anykind always listen to your heart.</p>For that you need to be connected to yourself so make sure to go for long walks without your earphones and mobile phones.
      <p>2. Don't cave into pressure from ANYONE. When that happens listen to them attentively, separate yourself from them all and just try not to think. Funny when you don't think constructive thoughts always thunderstrike you with the solution.</p>
      <p>3. Be tough.</p>
      <p>4. Be just the good person that you were young lady. The Priyanshi that I met was so awesome. Unlike the current pompous, weak woman that you have become now.</p>
      <p>5. Never let your style fade away. One of the things I love about you is your own FLAIR, SUAVE</p>
      <p>6. Last but not the least keep checking this LETTER. This shall be updated probably every now an then. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
