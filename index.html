      <h1>Checking in on 27th / Jan / 24  02:26 AM</h1>
      <p>
        It is tonight I am writing this virtual letter to you. ‚ù§Ô∏è I had called
        you earlier yesterday, wished you a very happy birthday. I am the most fucking
        clinical person, you somehow manage to melt me! EVERYTIMEü•∞üòò
      </p>
    <!-- </br> -->
      <p>
        I know you are too afraid that you do not want to go through the crap
        you went through earlier because of me again. Hence, I know you made a
        sly excuse that you had go see you grand mother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is the thing, only talking to you for 2 mins, makes my day but also reminds me of what I am losing out on!!!!
      </p>
      <p>I just so appreciate your presence so much in my life no matter how miniscule of a call it may be.</p>
      <p>It is 2:12 AM and I am here thinking of you rather than working on my professional shit.</p>

      </br>
      <p>I know I had my chance and everything and I regret letting you go.</p>
      <p>I am just writing this letter to you in hopes that it would bring warmth to you along with my love.</p>
      <p>I want you to know that the one hour we spent together was really so very important for me.</p>
      <p>I want to say that <b>"It was a lighting bolt on my forehead, you telling me you are moving to LONDON."</b></p>
      <!-- <p>How the fuck am I supposed to deal with this?</p> -->
      <p>But what I am actually gonna say to you is: <b>"I am really happy that you are going to a better place. A more secured place."</b></p>

      <h2 style="color: #c0026a">I LOVE YOU PRIYANSHI. Very Very Very much.</h2>
      <p>My odds are probably improving.üòé</p>
      <p>I want you to know I am doing BETTER in my life as well.</p>
      <p>I started journaling, my journal's name is PRIYANSHI‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞.</p>
      <p>In my mind I talk to you everyday and you are my bestest friend and I tell you all my secrets and intimate moments.</p>
      <p>The day you get married is when I will probably stop writing these letters. <b>( PROBABLY! )üòö</b></p>
      
      </br>
      <h2 style="color: #b50365">HAPPY BELATED BIRTHAY to the WOMAN who is so beautiful that she was not AFRAID to be VULNERABLE around me.</h2>
      <p>Young woman, I gotta tell you, you are more gutsy than I fathomed you. It takes a lot of guts to say <b>"It is OKAY with me even if YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE of me or my EMOTIONS !"</b></p>
      <p>I was literally this ü§èüèΩ close from pounding on you. I don't know what it was but I was legit turned on.</p>
      <p>That's it for now!</p>
      <p>You have all my LOVE and you can take my life too!‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
      <p>Do let me know if you read this message.     PS. The song is <b>"I want it that way "</b> ~by BACKSTREET BOYS</p>

      <h1>For My Beloved</h1>
      <p>
        Since, you couldn't keep a love letter with yourself all your life this
        is a place that will stay until the end of Electricity and I am going to
        try and emboss everything I wanna say on this very place.
      </p>
      <p>I love you more than words can express.</p>
      <p>You are the most beautiful person in my life.</p>
      <p>
        I know I did not give you enough time and I haven't exactly been the
        ideal boyfriend either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is the truth, right from the start I knew this relationship no
        matter how great and perfect it has to eventually come to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        I just knew I did not want to wreck your mental peace or your opinion
        about LOVE.
      </p>
      <p>
        I definitely tried very very very hard to not take advantage of you and
        your vulnerabilities.
        <span
          >(Gotta tell you wasn't easy at all cause you know MEN WILL BE
          MEN.)</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        However, that being said, in my own weird way, I tried to protect you
        from myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew there was a very good chance that I could make love to you and
        never marry you.
      </p>
      <p>I tried to do the right thing all along the way.</p>
      <p>This meant pushing you away.</p>
      <p>I know I have pushed you away so so many many times.</p>
      <p>
        And I truly am <b>SORRY</b> for that I didn't mean to disappoint or hurt
        you the way I have.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why I did not want to see you or talk to you as I knew that would
        create such ugly attachments for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, I never gave you all the time, gestures, efforts, affection,
        warmth, gestures that you truly deserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        You know I am a solo soarer and I never let my guards down. Infact I
        fake that I let people in and had my guards down by spending more time
        with them cracking more stupid jokes around them.
      </p>
      <p>However, with you its a different case.</p>
      <p>Very few people know me the way you do.</p>
      <p>They may alot about me but not about who I am.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Only my family and you know me in a way from which my vulnerabilities
          are visible.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>That is how much you mean to me.</p>
      <p>
        I also felt that you were perfect for me however, as I have grown up
        sacrificing so many of my wantsü•≤ that now I don't feel the deep hurt
        and pain that you would be feeling.
      </p>
      <p>So, I know you are miserable than me. Sorry for that as well.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WE DON'T ALWAYS GET WHAT WE WANT.</b> However, things turned out
        extremely great for me. I want you to have faith in your life and luck.
        I want you to be a WOMAN that makes me feel proud that I loved you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am gonna try and make sure that I BECOME THE MAN THAT GIVES YOU
        BUTTERFLIES EVERYTIME YOU THINK OF ME.
      </p>
      <p>I guess all the apologies that I wanna make is over here.</p>
      <p>Let me tell you good parts.</p>
      <p>Usually for me good time is SEX.</p>
      <p>With you it was only holding your hands, looking at your face.</p>
      <p>Also you might be only WOMAN that I paid forüòÇ.</p>
      <p>
        I have so bad trust issues with women that I don't let myself take risks
        around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, guess, what I am trying to say is that I fell for you as if I were
        knocked in OBLIVION.
      </p>
      <p>And you ALWAYS fear what you can't control.</p>
      <p>In contrast, for me I didn't fear being around you.</p>
      <p>I was loving it.</p>
      <p>
        My mother's happiness comes before your happiness, I am not a silly boy
        who would forget how my mom raised me by sleeping half hungry.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not the guy who will forget that her mother bought him new clothes,
        when she didn't fresh pair of undies for herself.
      </p>
      <p>So, I am breaking up with you.</p>
      <p>It is my call not to fight for you and sacrifice our relationship.</p>
      <p>
        I am a little disturbed/quirky whether or not this is the right thing to
        do or not. This may or may not be a mistake but if it is I will write
        here on this website again.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe sometime in the future.</p>
      <p>
        Look I love you. Letting you go is probably the biggest sacrifice I am
        making upto this point.
      </p>
      <p>LAST MINUTE ADVICE.</p>
      <p>
        1. Following your heart isn't always the best thing in the world
        practically speaking. However, when it comes to relationships be it
        friends, sexual, parents anykind always listen to your heart.
      </p>
      For that you need to be connected to yourself so make sure to go for long
      walks without your earphones and mobile phones.
      <p>
        2. Don't cave into pressure from ANYONE. When that happens listen to
        them attentively, separate yourself from them all and just try not to
        think. Funny when you don't think constructive thoughts always
        thunderstrike you with the solution.
      </p>
      <p>3. Be tough.</p>
      <p>
        4. Be just the good person that you were young lady. The Priyanshi that
        I met was so awesome. Unlike the current pompous, weak woman that you
        have become now.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Never let your style fade away. One of the things I love about you is
        your own FLAIR, SUAVE
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Last but not the least keep checking this LETTER. This shall be
        updated probably every now an then. ‚ù§Ô∏è
